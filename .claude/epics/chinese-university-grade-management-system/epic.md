# Epic: Chinese University Grade Management System

## Overview

Technical implementation of a Chinese university student grade management system MVP using Vue3 + FastAPI + SQLite + Shadcn. The system focuses on efficient batch grade entry through spreadsheet-like interfaces, real-time grade querying for students, and comprehensive grade statistics for teachers. Implements Chinese Ministry of Education 4.0 GPA standards and supports 500+ concurrent users with sub-2 second response times.

## Architecture Decisions

### Frontend Architecture
- **Vue 3 + Composition API**: Modern reactive framework with TypeScript for type safety
- **Shadcn-vue + Tailwind CSS**: Consistent, accessible UI components with Chinese localization
- **Pinia**: Centralized state management for user sessions and grade data
- **Element Plus Table Component**: High-performance spreadsheet-like grade editing interface
- **Vite**: Fast build tool for optimized development and production bundles

### Backend Architecture
- **FastAPI + Python**: High-performance async framework with automatic OpenAPI documentation
- **SQLAlchemy ORM**: Database abstraction layer with connection pooling
- **Pydantic**: Request/response validation with Chinese education data models
- **JWT Authentication**: Stateless token-based authentication with role-based access control
- **Pandas**: Efficient data processing for batch grade operations and analytics

### Database Design
- **SQLite**: MVP deployment with simple setup and maintenance
- **Relational Schema**: Normalized structure with foreign key constraints
- **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive logging for grade changes and system operations
- **Indexing Strategy**: Optimized queries for grade lookups and statistical reports

## Technical Approach

   - Real-time validation (0-100 range, GPA mapping)
   - Batch operations (add points, scale grades)

2. **Authentication Module**
   - Login form with student ID/faculty ID validation
   - Password reset with email verification
   - Role-based UI adaptation
   - Session management with automatic refresh

3. **Dashboard Components**
