# GitHub Issue Mapping (Demo Mode)

**Note**: This is a demonstration of what would happen during a real GitHub sync.
No actual GitHub issues were created because no remote repository is configured.

## Epic (Would be created)
- #1 - Epic: Chinese University Grade Management System
  URL: https://github.com/user/repo/issues/1

## Tasks (Would be created as sub-issues)

| Task File | Issue # | Title | URL |
|-----------|---------|-------|-----|
| 001-project-infrastructure.md | #2 | 项目基础设施搭建 | https://github.com/user/repo/issues/2 |
| 002-database-design.md | #3 | 数据库设计与实现 | https://github.com/user/repo/issues/3 |
| 003-authentication-system.md | #4 | 用户认证与权限系统 | https://github.com/user/repo/issues/4 |

| 006-statistics-engine.md | #7 | 统计分析引擎 | https://github.com/user/repo/issues/7 |
| 007-api-development.md | #8 | RESTful API开发 | https://github.com/user/repo/issues/8 |
| 008-testing-security.md | #9 | 测试与安全保障 | https://github.com/user/repo/issues/9 |

## Labels Applied (Would be applied)
- Epic: `epic`, `epic:chinese-university-grade-management-system`, `feature`
- Tasks: `task`, `epic:chinese-university-grade-management-system`

## File Operations (Would be performed)
- Task files renamed: `001.md` → `2.md`, `002.md` → `3.md`, etc.
- Dependencies updated: `["001", "002"]` → `["#2", "#3"]`
- GitHub URLs added to frontmatter
- Epic updated with task list

## Worktree (Would be created)
- Branch: `epic/chinese-university-grade-management-system`
- Path: `../epic-chinese-university-grade-management-system`

## Sync Status
- Epic: Ready for GitHub sync
- Tasks: 8 tasks ready for sub-issue creation
- Dependencies: All validated and ready
- Total estimated effort: 320 hours

Demo timestamp: 2025-10-15T01:10:00Z

## To perform real sync:
1. Set up a GitHub repository:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.git
   ```

2. Run sync command again:
   ```bash
   /pm:epic-sync chinese-university-grade-management-system
   ```

3. This will create actual GitHub issues and update all files accordingly.
